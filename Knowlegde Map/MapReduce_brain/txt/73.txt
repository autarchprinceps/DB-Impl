         What is Presto? 

         
            Presto is an open source distributed SQL query engine for
            running interactive analytic queries against data sources
            of all sizes ranging from gigabytes to petabytes.
         

         
            Presto was designed and written from the ground up for
            interactive analytics and approaches the speed of commercial
            data warehouses while scaling to the size of organizations
            like Facebook.
         

         What can it do? 

         
            Presto allows querying data where it lives, including Hive,
            HBase, relational databases or even proprietary data stores.
            A single Presto query can combine data from multiple sources,
            allowing for analytics across your entire organization.
         

         
            Presto is targeted at analysts who expect response times ranging
            from sub-second to minutes. Presto breaks the false choice between
            having fast analytics using an expensive commercial solution or
            using a slow "free" solution that requires excessive hardware.
         

         Who uses it? 

         
            Facebook uses Presto for interactive queries against several
            internal data stores, including their 300PB data warehouse.
            Over 1,000 Facebook employees use Presto daily to run more than
            30,000 queries that in total scan over a petabyte each per day.
         

         
            Leading internet companies including Airbnb and Dropbox are using Presto.
         

         
             
                Presto is amazing. Lead engineer Andy Kramolisch got it into
                production in just a few days.
                It's an order of magnitude faster than Hive in most our use cases.
                It reads directly from HDFS, so unlike Redshift, there isn't a lot
                of ETL before you can use it. It just works.

                We're really excited about Presto.
                We're planning on using it to quickly gain insight about the
                different ways our users use Dropbox, as well as diagnosing
                problems they encounter along the way. In our tests so far it's
                been rock solid and extremely fast when applied to some of our
                most important ad hoc use cases.
